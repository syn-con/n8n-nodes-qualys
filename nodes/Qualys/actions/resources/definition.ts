/**
 * The vocabulary every resource folder speaks.
 *
 * An operation is a data record, not code: it names the endpoint, how the
 * response is shaped, and which UI parameters it shows. The router and the
 * parameter builder both read these fields instead of branching on the resource
 * name, which is what keeps the menus and the requests from drifting apart.
 *
 * Endpoint versions in the resource tables are pinned to the only ones Qualys
 * still marks Active. Host List and Host List Detection 2.0-4.0 reached
 * End-of-Support in December 2025; the KnowledgeBase, Report and Dynamic Search
 * List APIs have each since moved a version on.
