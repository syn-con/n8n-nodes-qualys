/**
 * OT endpoints.
 *
 * VMDR OT: assets, vulnerabilities and project files discovered on the OT network.
 *
 * Everything here is data: which endpoint an operation calls, how its response
 * is shaped and which UI parameters it shows. The router reads these fields
 * rather than branching on the resource name, so adding an endpoint is an entry
 * in this table and nothing else.
